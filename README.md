# Django-React
This repo is the tutorial for better understanding of backend (Django) and frontend (react).
<h1>Backend</h1>
<h2>Django features:</h2>
High-level abstraction: Django provides a high-level, abstracted approach to web development, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than low-level details.
Admin interface: The built-in admin interface is a powerful tool for content management, allowing easy creation, update, and deletion of database records without writing custom admin panels.
URL routing: Django offers a flexible URL routing system, making it straightforward to map URLs to specific views and controllers. This feature is also helpful for developers to generate SEO-friendly URLs.
Security: Django emphasizes security, offering built-in protections against common web vulnerabilities like CSRF attacks, SQL injection, and XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).
<h2>Django benefits :</h2>
Django's high-level abstractions, built-in tools, and convention-over-configuration approach enable developers to build web applications quickly, reducing development time and effort.
Django supports horizontal scaling and load balancing, making it suitable for handling increased traffic and ensuring application growth as demands expand.
Django boasts an active and dedicated community, providing extensive documentation, tutorials, and third-party packages, making it convenient to find solutions to common challenges.
Django's REST framework extension simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs, making it a versatile choice for developing API-driven applications.
